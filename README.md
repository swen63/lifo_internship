# Research internship


## Affiliated organisations

- INSA Centre Val de Loire - France
- University of Orléans - France
- Computer Science Laboratory of Orléans (LIFO-EA 4022) - France

## Description

The placement is a (mandatory) research intership to conclude my fourth year of computer and cyber security engineering studies.  
The intership took place from May 2020 until August 2020 for a total duration of 4 months (17 weeks).  
The internship was concluded with a seminar held on November 12<exp>th</exp> 2020, assisted by LIFO fellows and CNIL officials.

## Repository content

- The internship's final report
- Attacks source code files
- Seminar's presentation (not sure whether the last version or not !!)

#### Notes

- Attack source codes are essentially developed in Python3, within the framework of the GDA Score software. They would only work if the software is properly set up and configured.
- Implemented codes aim essentially at testing anonymisation attack and defence algorithms, in the optic of further data and results analysis.
- The internship was fulfilled with the support of the researchers behind the GDA Score from the Max Planck Institute for Software Systems and Aircloak GmbH (Kaiserlautern, Germany).
